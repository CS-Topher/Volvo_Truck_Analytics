This is the progress report for the period ending September 23, 2019.  The following tasks have been completed or are being
actively worked on:

** Creation of file hierarchy and implmentation of Pandas dataframes **
This has been completed by James Polk.  The follow folders have been created: src/, doc/, /data, and util/.  Within the data
directory, an empty folder trucks/ for truck1.csv and truck2.csv can be found.  Since these files are too large to be uploaded to
GitHub, each team member is responsible for ensuring that the .csv files reside here in their local directories.  The dictionary
files for the two .csv files can be found in data/dictonary on the repository.  The src/ folder houses VolvoTrucksAnalytics.ipynb,
the main iPythin Notebook for the project.  Currently the util/ folder is unused.

Notebook blocks have been created for imports and constants, functions relating to data cleanup and wrangling, and logic for said
cleanup.  Functions for the creation of Pandas dataframes for each truck have been coded as well as the culling of extraenous UTC
date and time data that is already present in a DateTime stamp in the dataframe.  Finally, some basic data statistics regarding
the volume of the data has been presented.

** Determine vehicle travel designation and update ReadMe.md on git **


** Adjust and format the data dictionary to metrics being used **


** Determine whether there are rows or columns with all NaN values, if so remove them **


** Merge weights together to determine how weight affects performance of the vehicles **
