GPS Speed vs. Wheel-Based Speed Analysis & Determination of Long/Short Haul Trucks (12+ hours)
The goal of this task was to compare GPS Speed and Wheel-Based Vehicle Speed for Truck 1 and Truck 2 internally through visual
representation and percent change, and then compare the results for each truck to each other. The results revealed a major issue
with the speed data: they are bimodal. There are two peaks for the distributions which represent a "stop" state and a
"go" state, with "stop" being all of the zero or near-zero values and "go" being all of the values at the rightmost peak near the higher
readings. This is a problem because it causes the average speed for the trucks to become inaccurate. In addition to this, the GPS Speed
readings for Truck 2 are significantly lower than its Wheel-Based counterpart, but this isn't true for Truck 1's data: they are fairly
consistent with each other in terms of hard-value readings. However, the trends are the same between the two columns in Truck 2, which
indicates that the GPS Speed component was misconfigured. Finally, this initial and basic analysis of these two columns has indicated
that the long-haul truck is Truck 1 and the short-haul is Truck 2.

GitHub Repository Management (estimated 5+ hours)
For most of Project Progress 2, I have been given the responsibility of managing the GitHub repository in a multitude of ways. This
includes updating the home page README, creating, updating, and closing Issues, creating and assigning Labels to those Issues,
managing and assigning group members to those Issues, and trying to keep the general repository structure simple and clean.

ONCE EVERYONE HAS ADDED THEIR PARTS: I will convert this into a Word document and format it nicely for the professor.
