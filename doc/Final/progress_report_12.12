Rename Columns to Be More Readable (~2 hours)
The data that's been provided isn't very useful if we can't understand what it means, so the provided column names needed to be changed.
These changes included removing unnecessary column name parts, changing title formats, and including the unit of measurement, if 
provided, to the title for easier readability. Ambiguous titles were clarified to the best of the team's knowledge to-date, but slight 
changes may come in the future. The created function changes the column names with a Python dictionary which is currently being 
generated by CSV files.

GPS Speed vs. Wheel-Based Speed Analysis & Determination of Long/Short Haul Trucks (16+ hours)
The goal of this task was to compare GPS Speed and Wheel-Based Vehicle Speed for Truck 1 and Truck 2 internally through visual
representation and percent change, and then compare the results for each truck to each other. The results revealed a major issue
with the speed data: they are bimodal. There are two peaks for the distributions which represent a "stop" state and a
"go" state, with "stop" being all of the zero or near-zero values and "go" being all of the values at the rightmost peak near the higher
readings. This is a problem because it causes the average speed for the trucks to become inaccurate. In addition to this, the GPS Speed
readings for Truck 2 are significantly lower than its Wheel-Based counterpart, but this isn't true for Truck 1's data: they are fairly
consistent with each other in terms of hard-value readings. However, the trends are the same between the two columns in Truck 2, which
indicates that the GPS Speed component was misconfigured. Finally, this initial and basic analysis of these two columns has indicated
that the long-haul truck is Truck 1 and the short-haul is Truck 2.

Truck 2 GPS Speed Corrections (~4 hours)
As we learned from Project Progress two (2), Truck 2 has some faulty data for its GPS Speed
component. This is a bigger issue for Volvo than us, but my questions from this was "how well
would this component work if it was completely functional and what would its more correct
measurements look like?" Thankfully, Truck 1's components appear to be working perfectly fine.
This means I was able to use Truck 1's data as a model to predict what Truck 2's GPS Speed values
_should_ be. To solve this issue, I took the difference of means for Truck 1's GPS Speed and
Wheel-Based Speeds. Using that value, I iterated through Truck 2's Wheel-Based Speed values and
added that mean to each value and stored the result into a separate column. These calculated values
were the "predicted" GPS Speed values for Truck 2. I created visualizations and calculated their values 
to better analyze the results, and those results appear to be fairly consistent with the correctly measured
values for Truck 1. 

GitHub Repository Management (~10 hours)
For most of Project Progress 2, I have been given the responsibility of managing the GitHub repository in a multitude of ways. This
includes updating the home page README, creating, updating, and closing Issues, creating and assigning Labels to those Issues,
managing and assigning group members to those Issues, and trying to keep the general repository structure simple and clean.
