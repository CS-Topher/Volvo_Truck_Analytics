Vehicle Temp Analysis (6+ hours)
The goal of this task was to determine if the external temperature affected the performance of the vehicle. 
The results showed that the external temperature was inline with the temperature of the internal temperature 
readings of the vehicle. After seeing this result, I decided to do some research and discovered that the external 
temperature does not affect performance unless the temperature is extreme and the feature (or part) that is affected 
the most is the turbocharger, because it is compressing the hot intake air. If the ambient air is increased, the 
turbocharger has to do more work in order to proved the engine with the same amount of oxygen. If the temperature 
continues to increase, the turbocharger will eventually hit a maximum speed and will no longer provide enough oxygen 
to the engine resulting in a loss of power.

Display Data by day (about 3 hours) 
Function implementation of display data by day was created to sort all data by average for each day for a certain attribute. 
Goal was to create a cleaner way of looking at data to find somthing interesting. We were able to find out that data for Truck one 
data was the week of data or seven days which was expected, but for truck two there was only 3 days worth of data which was less then we were told.
This means we'll have to decide which days to compare when comparing the two trucks and which days will be not usefull.

Outlier Detection data (about 12 hours)
This function was made to detect all the outliers in the data for a certian attribute and have a boxplot made for visuals. 
Even though the data for truck one was 7 days worth, the averages were very far appart making me think if there are alot of outliers 
and after running it through the function I was able to find out that the last 3 days of data for truck one was outliers. Meaning 
there were three days worth of no useful data for Speed (km/hr)

Determining Estimator (about 3 hour)
Was able to determine to use the Kernel Density Estimatior (KDE) becasue of it being non-parametric. For the banwidth I decided to 
use a larger bandwidth since our data was scattered around. Use of this function will be benefitial in the future. 
We used this because our data had large amount of outliers and was not a normal distribution. Maybe after removing the outliers 
we will switch to MLE. And we didnt choose MoM because that is also for normal distribtions and not as effective in our case becasue of 
our several outliers in the data.

GPS Speed vs. Wheel-Based Speed Analysis & Determination of Long/Short Haul Trucks (12+ hours)
The goal of this task was to compare GPS Speed and Wheel-Based Vehicle Speed for Truck 1 and Truck 2 internally through visual
representation and percent change, and then compare the results for each truck to each other. The results revealed a major issue
with the speed data: they are bimodal. There are two peaks for the distributions which represent a "stop" state and a
"go" state, with "stop" being all of the zero or near-zero values and "go" being all of the values at the rightmost peak near the higher
readings. This is a problem because it causes the average speed for the trucks to become inaccurate. In addition to this, the GPS Speed
readings for Truck 2 are significantly lower than its Wheel-Based counterpart, but this isn't true for Truck 1's data: they are fairly
consistent with each other in terms of hard-value readings. However, the trends are the same between the two columns in Truck 2, which
indicates that the GPS Speed component was misconfigured. Finally, this initial and basic analysis of these two columns has indicated
that the long-haul truck is Truck 1 and the short-haul is Truck 2.

GitHub Repository Management (estimated 5+ hours)
For most of Project Progress 2, I have been given the responsibility of managing the GitHub repository in a multitude of ways. This
includes updating the home page README, creating, updating, and closing Issues, creating and assigning Labels to those Issues,
managing and assigning group members to those Issues, and trying to keep the general repository structure simple and clean.

ONCE EVERYONE HAS ADDED THEIR PARTS: I will convert this into a Word document and format it nicely for the professor.
