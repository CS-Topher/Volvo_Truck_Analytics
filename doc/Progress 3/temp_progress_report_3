Created a multiple linear regression model to check engine manifold temperature. <~5 hours>
After seeing how ambient air temperature affected the Turbospeed, I was interested in seeing if I could use outside
temperature and other engine temperatures to predict the temperature of the manifold. I thought this could be useful
in determining whether or not a part was going out. My first model was created by just "doing it" and seeing what I 
came up with. I received a score of .734 percent accurate, which is pretty good. But I wanted to try and make a better one
so I tried doing backward elimination. Unfortunately, my p-values are so low, I'm not sure it would improve my model anymore
to attempt it. Need to do more research to see if I should modify my model better.

Truck 2 GPS Speed Corrections (~4 hours)
As we learned from Project Progress two (2), Truck 2 has some faulty data for its GPS Speed
component. This is a bigger issue for Volvo than us, but my questions from this was "how well
would this component work if it was completely functional and what would its more correct
measurements look like?" Thankfully, Truck 1's components appear to be working perfectly fine.
This means I was able to use Truck 1's data as a model to predict what Truck 2's GPS Speed values
_should_ be. To solve this issue, I took the difference of means for Truck 1's GPS Speed and
Wheel-Based Speeds. Using that value, I iterated through Truck 2's Wheel-Based Speed values and
added that mean to each value and stored the result into a separate column. These calculated values
were the "predicted" GPS Speed values for Truck 2. I created visualizations and calculated their values 
to better analyze the results, and those results appear to be fairly consistent with the correctly measured
values for Truck 1. 

Github Repository Management (~3 hours)
For most of Project Progress Three (3), I have been given the responsibility of managing the GitHub repository in a multitude of ways. This
includes updating the home page README, creating, updating, and closing Issues, creating and assigning Labels to those Issues,
managing and assigning group members to those Issues, and trying to keep the general repository structure simple and clean.
