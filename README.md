 ## Goals
 -To anaylize Volvo vehicle Long haul and short haul data
 
 -Use time series to aid in visualizations for analysis 
 
 -To determine if different metrics logged by sensors make a difference in relation to an "APU" module that is not dependent on power from   the motor  
 
 -report any discovered anomolies detected by data manipulations 
 
 ## Objectives: 
The following are the main areas that Volvo is interested in our group looking into. 

1.Clean data and determine which vehicle is longhaul and short haul.

2. Remove unused rows or columns

3. Merge vehicles to identify if APU unit is making a difference on fuel economy or possible engine longivity.

4. Identify commonality in features detailed from data dictionary with or without APU unit.

5. Anomoly Detection within the data 

6. grouping/clustering or other visualizations in data manipulations
