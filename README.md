 ## Goals
 
 -To anaylize Volvo vehicle Long haul and short haul data
 
 -Use time series to aid in visualizations for analysis 
 
 -To determine if different metrics logged by sensors make a difference in relation to an "APU" module that is not dependent on power from   the motor  
 
 -report any discovered anomolies detected by data manipulations 
 
 ## Objectives:
 
 The following are the main areas that Volvo is interested in our group looking into. 

-Clean data and determine which vehicle is longhaul and short haul.

-Remove unused rows or columns

-Merge vehicles to identify if APU unit is making a difference on fuel economy or possible engine longivity.

-Identify commonality in features detailed from data dictionary with or without APU unit.

-Anomoly Detection within the data 

-Grouping/clustering or other visualizations in data manipulations
